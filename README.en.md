# Lyrics Search Plugin

Automatically searches [lrclib.net](https://lrclib.net) or a compatible custom API when a song has no lyrics. The plugin registers as a server-side lyric provider, which the host calls when needed.

## Installation

1. Download [lyrics.jsplugin.zip](../../releases/latest).
2. Place it in Songloft's `data/jsplugins/` directory.
3. Restart Songloft.

## Features

- **Automatic search**: registers as a server-side lyric provider for songs without lyrics.
- **Exact and fuzzy matching**: tries title, artist, album, and duration first, then falls back to fuzzy search.
- **Synced lyrics preferred**: favors results with LRC timestamps.
- **Custom API**: supports a self-hosted lrclib-compatible API.
- **Configuration page**: a web UI for enabling search, configuring providers, and testing searches.

## Usage

### Enable the plugin

Search is **disabled** by default. Open the configuration page, enable lyric search, and save. Enabling search registers the lyric provider with the host; disabling it unregisters the provider.

### Choose a provider

- **lrclib.net** (default): an open lyric database with no registration required.
- **Custom API**: enter an lrclib-compatible API address with `/api/get` for exact lookup and `/api/search` for fuzzy search.

### Test a search

The bottom of the configuration page lets you test connectivity and matching using a song title and artist.

### Smart speaker player page

The smart speaker plugin calls this provider through the host's song lyrics endpoint, so no separate lyric provider configuration is needed there. In addition to enabling the plugin itself, save the lyric search toggle in its settings. Play a library song and open the smart speaker plugin's lyrics page to search automatically; newer speaker plugin versions also provide a button to fetch lyrics again. Spaces in titles, artists, and albums are preserved, as are literal `+` characters.

These lyrics appear on the plugin's web page. Lyrics on a speaker's touchscreen use the smart speaker plugin's separate touchscreen lyrics setting.

### Automatic releases

Pushing to `main` automatically releases each non-documentation commit as `YYYY.M.D.N` using Beijing time, starting each day at `.0`. Markdown-only or `docs/` changes produce no package, and version metadata commits do not trigger recursive releases. Failed runs can resume manually without replacing existing tags or Releases. Each package requires clean dependency installation, type checking, tests, a QuickJS build, and artifact hash validation.

See [Automatic releases](docs/en/releases.md) for the full rules, migration checkpoint, and local verification.
